# indieremovespam
Remove chinese movie spam from IndieHackers with a simple UserScript

To use this you first have to install a UserScript manager. If you are using chrome I'd recommend https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo

Once installed click on the TamperMonkey icon and press 'Create a new Script'

Replace everything with the code from 'removespam.js' into the newly created userscript.

Hit Save (Ctrl + S)

Test it out :)
